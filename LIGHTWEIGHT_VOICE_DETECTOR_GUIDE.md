## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages
python -m pip install -r requirements_lightweight_voice.txt

# Or install individually
python -m pip install opencv-python numpy pyttsx3 google-generativeai torch torchvision ultralytics Pillow requests
```

### 2. Set Up Gemini API (Optional)
```bash
# Set your Gemini API key for AI analysis
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# On Windows
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the System
```bash
# Use the launcher (recommended)
python run_lightweight_voice.py

# Or run directly
python lightweight_voice_detector.py
```

## üéÆ Controls

- **`q`**: Quit the application
- **`s`**: Save results manually
- **`Ctrl+C`**: Force quit

## üìÅ Files Created

### Core Files
- `lightweight_voice_detector.py` - Main detection system
- `run_lightweight_voice.py` - Smart launcher with dependency checking
- `requirements_lightweight_voice.txt` - Package dependencies
- `test_voice_output.py` - Test script for verification

### Output Files
- `lightweight_detection_results.json` - Detection results with timestamps

## üîß Configuration

### Camera Settings
```python
self.frame_width = 320    # Resolution width
self.frame_height = 240   # Resolution height  
self.fps = 30            # Target FPS
```

### Detection Settings
```python
self.confidence_threshold = 0.5  # Minimum confidence for detections
self.gemini_cooldown = 5.0       # Seconds between AI analysis calls
```

### Voice Settings
```python
self.engine.setProperty('rate', 150)    # Speech speed
self.engine.setProperty('volume', 0.8)  # Volume level
self.cooldown = 3.0                     # Seconds between same announcements
```

## üéØ Voice Announcements

The system provides voice feedback for:

- **Face Detection**: "Detected X face(s)"
- **Vehicle Detection**: "Detected X vehicle(s): car, truck, etc."
- **Traffic Signs**: "Detected X traffic sign(s): stop_sign, etc."
- **AI Analysis**: "AI Analysis: [description]"

## üîç Detection Details

### Face Detection
- Uses OpenCV Haar Cascade classifier
- Detects frontal faces in real-time
- Confidence threshold: 0.5

### Vehicle Detection
- YOLOv5 model with COCO dataset
- Vehicle classes: car, truck, bus, motorcycle, bicycle
- GPU acceleration if available

### Traffic Sign Detection
- Color-based detection using HSV color space
- Red detection for stop signs
- Blue detection for other traffic signs
- Shape analysis for stop sign validation

### AI Analysis (Gemini)
- Scene understanding and description
- Safety concern identification
- Traffic sign and signal detection
- Rate-limited to prevent API spam

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Target FPS**: 30
- **Resolution**: 320x240 (optimized for speed)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (lightweight models)
- **CPU Usage**: Optimized for real-time processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Voice Issues
```bash
# Reinstall voice package
python -m pip uninstall pyttsx3
python -m pip install pyttsx3
```

### Camera Issues
```bash
# Test camera access
python -c "import cv2; cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); print('Camera OK' if cap.isOpened() else 'Camera Failed')"
```

### Model Loading Issues
```bash
# Clear torch cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/torch/hub/
# Reinstall ultralytics
python -m pip install --force-reinstall ultralytics
```

### Performance Issues
- Reduce resolution in `lightweight_voice_detector.py`
- Disable vehicle detection by setting `YOLO_AVAILABLE = False`
- Increase `gemini_cooldown` for fewer AI calls

## üéâ Success Indicators

‚úÖ **System Ready**: All dependencies installed  
‚úÖ **Camera Working**: Camera access confirmed  
‚úÖ **Voice Active**: Voice announcements working  
‚úÖ **Detection Running**: Real-time detection active  
‚úÖ **FPS Stable**: Consistent 25-30 FPS  

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Custom Voice Messages
```python
# In lightweight_voice_detector.py
self.voice.announce('custom', 'Your custom message here')
```

### Custom Detection Classes
```python
# Add new vehicle classes
vehicle_classes = ['car', 'truck', 'bus', 'motorcycle', 'bicycle', 'your_class']
```

### Integration with Other Systems
```python
# Import and use in other scripts
from lightweight_voice_detector import LightweightVoiceDetector
detector = LightweightVoiceDetector()
# Use detector methods
```

## üîÑ Updates & Maintenance
